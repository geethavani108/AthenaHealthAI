athenahealth's AI-powered Clinical Decision Support (CDS) systems help healthcare professionals in several ways like:

Accurate Diagnoses: By analyzing vast amounts of patient data, medical literature, and clinical guidelines, AI algorithms can identify patterns and anomalies that might be missed by human clinicians. This helps in making more accurate diagnoses1.

Evidence-Based Recommendations: The AI system provides evidence-based treatment recommendations, ensuring that healthcare providers are making decisions backed by the latest research and best practices.

Reducing Human Error: By automating the analysis of complex data, the AI reduces the risk of human error, leading to better patient outcomes.

Efficiency: AI streamlines the decision-making process, allowing healthcare providers to make quicker and more informed decisions, which is especially crucial in emergency situations.

Combining Generative AI and Predictive AI: While Generative AI might not be suitable for direct diagnosis, it can complement other AI models that specialize in predictive analytics. For example:
Generative AI can help in creating detailed and human-readable patient summaries, educational materials for patients, 
Predictive AI models, such as deep learning algorithms trained on medical data, can analyze patterns and assist in making accurate diagnoses.

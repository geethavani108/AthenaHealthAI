/*1. Feature Selection
Select the most relevant features to use in your machine learning model. You can use techniques like correlation analysis, feature importance, or recursive feature elimination.

2. Model Selection
Choose a machine learning model that is appropriate for your problem. Common models for binary classification problems like heart disease prediction include:
Logistic Regression|Random Forest|Gradient Boosting|Support Vector Machines (SVM)|K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
/*Load the Data: The dataset is loaded, and categorical variables are encoded. The data is then split into training and testing sets.
Cross-Validation Accuracy:
Purpose: To estimate the model's performance on unseen data and compare different models.
How It Works: The cross_val_score function performs cross-validation by splitting the training data into several folds, training the model on some folds while validating it on the remaining fold. This process is repeated multiple times (5 times in this example), and the results are averaged to obtain the cross-validation accuracy.
Train and Evaluate Each Model:
Purpose: To train each model on the entire training dataset and evaluate its performance on the test dataset.
How It Works: Each model is trained using the fit method, predictions are made using the predict method, and the model's performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

3. Model Training and Evaluation
Train your model on the training data and evaluate its performance using the test data.

4. Hyperparameter Tuning
Optimize the model's hyperparameters to improve its performance.

5. Model Validation
Use cross-validation to ensure the model's robustness and prevent overfitting.
/* Explanation:
Cross-Validation: cross_val_score is used to perform K-Fold Cross-Validation and obtain the average accuracy and standard deviation.
Best Model Selection: After cross-validation, the best-performing model (Random Forest in this example) is selected and trained on the entire training set.
Final Evaluation: The best model is then evaluated on the test set to get an unbiased estimate of its performance.
Model validation ensures that the selected model generalizes well to new data and helps in choosing the best model for your problem.
